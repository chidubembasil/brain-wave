BRAINWAVE - CLEAR MOBILE CACHE INSTRUCTIONS
============================================

The features page has been updated with mobile fixes.
To see the changes on your mobile device, please do ONE of the following:

OPTION 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
-------------------------------------
On your mobile browser:
- Chrome (Android): Tap the three dots menu → Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Select "Cached images and files" → Clear data
- Safari (iOS): Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
- Or simply close and reopen the browser app completely

OPTION 2: Force Reload
-----------------------
- Add ?v=2 to the end of the URL
- Instead of: http://10.138.189.121:8000/features.html
- Use: http://10.138.189.121:8000/features.html?v=2

OPTION 3: Private/Incognito Mode
---------------------------------
- Open the URL in a private/incognito browser window
- This bypasses the cache completely

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============
✓ "Mock Examinations" text now fits in its box
✓ "Live Classes" text now fits in its box
✓ All feature titles properly wrap on mobile
✓ Container widths constrained to prevent overflow
✓ Font sizes optimized for mobile screens
✓ Added cache-control headers to prevent future caching issues

After clearing cache, the text should display properly within the feature boxes!
